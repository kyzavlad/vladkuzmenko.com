## Implementation Details

### Face Detection Ensemble

The face detection ensemble combines three complementary models:

1. **YOLO Face Detector**: Fast and accurate general-purpose face detection
2. **MediaPipe Face Detector**: Precise facial landmark detection
3. **RetinaFace Detector**: Robust detection in challenging lighting conditions

The ensemble can operate in three modes:
- **Cascade**: Run detectors in sequence, stopping when faces are found
- **Parallel**: Run all detectors and merge results
- **Weighted**: Combine results with confidence weighting

### Kalman Filtering for Temporal Consistency

The Kalman filter implementation tracks both position and velocity components of face bounding boxes, enabling:
- Prediction of face positions in future frames
- Smooth tracking during occlusions
- Consistent face identity maintenance
- Adaptive tuning based on detection confidence

### Smart Framing System

The smart framing system implements professional cinematography techniques:
- **Rule of Thirds**: Places faces at optimal positions in the frame
- **Speaker Focus**: Prioritizes the current speaker in multi-person scenes
- **Smooth Camera Movement**: Implements temporal smoothing to avoid jerky movements
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains visual context around the primary subject

### Performance Optimization

The performance optimization module enables real-time processing through several techniques:

#### Frame Sampling Strategies
- **Uniform Sampling**: Process every Nth frame for consistent performance
- **Adaptive Sampling**: Dynamically adjust sampling rate based on processing load
- **Keyframe Sampling**: Process only frames with significant scene changes
- **Motion-Based Sampling**: Increase processing rate during high-motion sequences

#### GPU Acceleration
- CUDA integration for OpenCV operations
- GPU-accelerated model inference
- Efficient memory transfer between CPU and GPU

#### Batch Processing
- Multi-threaded worker pool for parallel frame processing
- Asynchronous queue management for optimized throughput
- Batch detection for improved model efficiency

#### Benchmarking System
- Comprehensive benchmark tool to compare different optimization strategies
- Performance visualization and reporting
- Configuration recommendations based on hardware capabilities

### API Integration

The face tracking system is fully integrated with the Clip Generation Service API, providing:
- Synchronous face detection in images
- Asynchronous video processing with face tracking
- Task management and status monitoring
- Result retrieval and cleanup

## Usage Examples

### Basic Face Detection

```python
from app.clip_generation.services.face_tracking_manager import FaceTrackingManager
import cv2

# Initialize face tracking manager
tracker = FaceTrackingManager(model_dir="models")

# Read an image
image = cv2.imread("example.jpg")

# Process the image
tracked_faces = tracker.process_frame(image)

# Display information about detected faces
for face_id, face in tracked_faces.items():
    print(f"Face {face_id}: Position: {face.box.to_dict()}")
    if face.identity:
        print(f"  Identified as: {face.identity.name}")
    print(f"  Is speaker: {face.is_speaker}")
```

### Video Processing with Smart Framing

```python
from app.clip_generation.services.face_tracking_manager import FaceTrackingManager
from app.clip_generation.services.smart_framing import SmartFraming
import cv2

# Initialize components
tracker = FaceTrackingManager(model_dir="models")
framer = SmartFraming(target_width=1280, target_height=720)

# Open video
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("input.mp4")
out = cv2.VideoWriter("output.mp4", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'), 30, (1280, 720))

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
        
    # Process frame with face tracking
    tracked_faces = tracker.process_frame(frame)
    
    # Get current speaker
    speaker_id = tracker.speaker_id
    
    # Apply smart framing
    framed_image, _ = framer.frame_image(frame, tracked_faces, speaker_id)
    
    # Write output
    out.write(framed_image)

# Clean up
cap.release()
out.release()
```
