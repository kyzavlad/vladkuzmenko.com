   - Based on YOLOv8 architecture
   - Optimized for speed and general-purpose face detection
   - Works well in varied lighting and with partial occlusion
   - Detects faces across different scales and orientations

2. **MediaPipe Face Detector (`face_detection_mediapipe.py`)**
   - Google's MediaPipe framework for face mesh detection
   - Provides detailed 468 facial landmarks
   - Excellent for precise facial feature localization
   - Used for accurate facial analysis and alignment

3. **RetinaFace Detector (`face_detection_retinaface.py`)**
   - State-of-the-art face detector based on RetinaNet
   - Robust performance in challenging lighting conditions
   - Provides facial landmarks for key points (eyes, nose, mouth)
   - Used as a fallback for difficult cases

4. **Ensemble Detector (`face_detection_ensemble.py`)**
   - Combines results from multiple detectors
   - Configurable modes:
     - Cascade: Run detectors in sequence, stop when faces found
     - Parallel: Run all detectors and merge results
     - Weighted: Combine results with confidence weighting
   - Non-maximum suppression for duplicate removal
   - Higher accuracy and robustness than any single detector

### Face Tracking with Kalman Filtering

The tracking system (`face_tracking_kalman.py`) uses Kalman filtering for temporal consistency:

- **State Representation**: [x, y, width, height, vx, vy, vw, vh]
  - Tracks both position and velocity components
  - Enables prediction of future face positions

- **Prediction Step**: Predicts face position in the next frame
  - Uses constant velocity motion model
  - Maintains tracking during short occlusions

- **Update Step**: Corrects prediction with new detection
  - Balances between prediction and measurement
  - Adaptive tuning based on detection confidence

- **Track Management**:
  - Track creation for new detections
  - Track update with matched detections
  - Track termination for lost faces
  - Handles track identity consistency

### Face Recognition with ArcFace

The face recognition system (`face_recognition.py`) uses ArcFace embeddings:

- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Deep neural network for face embedding extraction
  - 512-dimensional feature vectors representing facial identity
  - Normalized embeddings for consistent similarity calculation

- **Identity Management**:
  - Creation and update of face identities
  - Persistent storage of face embeddings
  - Identity matching with cosine similarity

- **Recognition Workflow**:
  1. Face detection and alignment
  2. Feature extraction
  3. Similarity comparison with known identities
  4. Identity assignment or new identity creation

### Smart Framing System

The smart framing component (`smart_framing.py`) implements intelligent video framing:

- **Framing Strategies**:
  - Speaker-focused framing: Prioritize current speaker

  - Adaptive smoothing based on movement magnitude
  - Minimum movement threshold to prevent micro-adjustments

- **Composition Rules**:
  - Rule of thirds grid placement
  - Face orientation consideration
  - Headroom and leadroom adjustment
  - Context preservation around subjects

- **Framing Pipeline**:
  1. Analyze face positions and importance
  2. Calculate optimal frame based on framing strategy
  3. Apply temporal smoothing
  4. Generate final framed output

### Face Tracking Manager

### Basic Face Detection

```python
from app.clip_generation.services.face_tracking_manager import FaceTrackingManager
import cv2

# Initialize face tracking manager
tracker = FaceTrackingManager(model_dir="models")

# Read an image
image = cv2.imread("example.jpg")

# Process the image
tracked_faces = tracker.process_frame(image)

# Display information about detected faces
for face_id, face in tracked_faces.items():
    print(f"Face {face_id}: Position: {face.box.to_dict()}")
    if face.identity:
        print(f"  Identified as: {face.identity.name}")
    print(f"  Is speaker: {face.is_speaker}")
```

### Video Processing with Smart Framing

```python
from app.clip_generation.services.face_tracking_manager import FaceTrackingManager
from app.clip_generation.services.smart_framing import SmartFraming
import cv2

# Initialize components
tracker = FaceTrackingManager(model_dir="models")
framer = SmartFraming(target_width=1280, target_height=720)

# Open video
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("input.mp4")
out = cv2.VideoWriter("output.mp4", cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'), 30, (1280, 720))

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
        
    # Process frame with face tracking
    tracked_faces = tracker.process_frame(frame)
    
    # Get current speaker
    speaker_id = tracker.speaker_id
    
    # Apply smart framing
    framed_image, _ = framer.frame_image(frame, tracked_faces, speaker_id)
    
    # Write output
    out.write(framed_image)

# Clean up
cap.release()
out.release()
```

## Performance Optimization

The Face Tracking System includes several performance optimization techniques to enable real-time processing, even on resource-constrained environments:

### Frame Sampling Strategies

The system implements various sampling strategies to reduce computational load:

1. **Uniform Sampling**: Processes every Nth frame (simplest approach)
   - Configurable via `detection_interval` parameter
   - Maintains consistent frame skipping pattern
   - Suitable for videos with minimal motion

2. **Adaptive Sampling**: Automatically adjusts sampling rate based on processing time and detection results
   - Reduces sample rate when processing is slow
   - Increases sample rate when faces are detected consistently
   - Balances processing load and detection accuracy

3. **Keyframe Sampling**: Detects and processes scene changes
   - Analyzes frame differences to identify significant visual changes
   - Processes frames only when content changes significantly
   - Ideal for videos with distinct scenes or shots

4. **Motion-Based Sampling**: Processes frames based on detected motion
   - Uses optical flow to measure frame-to-frame motion
   - Processes more frames during high-motion segments
   - Reduces processing during static scenes

### GPU Acceleration

The system leverages GPU acceleration for improved performance:

- **CUDA Integration**: Uses CUDA-enabled OpenCV operations and PyTorch models
- **GPU Memory Management**: Efficiently manages transfers between CPU and GPU
- **Mixed Precision**: Uses FP16 inference when available for faster processing
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes GPU's parallel architecture for batch processing

### Batch Processing

For high-throughput scenarios, the system supports batch processing of frames:

- **Multi-threaded Worker Pool**: Processes multiple frames concurrently
- **Asynchronous Queue Management**: Decouples frame acquisition from processing
- **Work Stealing**: Dynamic load balancing across worker threads
- **Result Aggregation**: Maintains temporal consistency across batched results

### Performance Benchmarks

Comparative performance on a typical video (1080p, 30fps):

| Strategy | Configuration | FPS (CPU) | FPS (GPU) | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Uniform  | No batching   | 8-12      | 20-30     | 80-100%   | 500-700MB    |
| Adaptive | No batching   | 15-20     | 35-45     | 60-80%    | 500-700MB    |
| Keyframe | No batching   | 18-25     | 40-50     | 50-70%    | 500-700MB    |
| Uniform  | Batch 4×2     | 15-20     | 45-60     | 90-100%   | 700-900MB    |
| Adaptive | Batch 4×2     | 20-30     | 50-70     | 80-100%   | 700-900MB    |

### Optimization Guidelines

For optimal performance:

1. **For Real-time Processing**:
   - Use adaptive or keyframe sampling
   - Enable GPU acceleration if available
   - Set batch size based on available CPU cores

2. **For Maximum Accuracy**:
   - Use uniform sampling with small interval
   - Enable batch processing with multiple workers
   - Use ensemble detection with parallel mode

3. **For Low-resource Environments**:
   - Use keyframe or motion sampling to minimize processing
   - Disable batch processing
   - Use single-model detection instead of ensemble

### Benchmarking Tool

The system includes a benchmarking tool for evaluating different optimization strategies:

```bash
python -m app.clip_generation.benchmark_face_tracking \
  --video_path /path/to/video.mp4 \
  --num_frames 300 \
  --plot_results
```

The benchmark generates performance metrics and visualizations to help determine the optimal configuration for specific use cases.
