Multi-Face Support Module for Group Videos

This module provides specialized functionality for handling multiple speakers
in group videos, allowing synchronized lip movements for all participants in
a video translation scenario.

Key features:
- Detection and tracking of multiple faces
- Speaker diarization for multi-person scenes
- Individual lip synchronization for each speaker
- Consistent identity preservation across frames
- Handling of face occlusions and reappearances
- Support for group conversations with turn-taking
